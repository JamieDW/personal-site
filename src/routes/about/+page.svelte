						<p>
							I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my first program
							when I was 2 months old, just two weeks after my mom brought home the brand new
							Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to type on.
						</p>
						<p>
							The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When I was 8, I climbed
							the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard while wearing my older sister’s
							motorcycle helmet, counted down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall
							enough that with just a bit of momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.
						</p>
						<p>
							I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design, while I recovered
							from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my badly broken legs. It took nine
							iterations, but when I was 15 I sent my dad’s Blackberry into orbit and was able to
							transmit a photo back down to our family computer from space.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, I’m the founder of Planetaria, where we’re working on civilian space suits and
							manned shuttle kits you can assemble at home so that the next generation of kids
							really <em>can</em> make it to orbit — from the comfort of their own backyards.
